## üöÄ Project Overview

The Cognito $\omega$ System represents the pinnacle of AI assistant development, designed for maximum efficiency, safety, and sophistication. It moves beyond simple chatbot interaction by implementing a 15-node, stateful graph that features **specialized expertise, autonomous self-improvement, multi-modal input processing, and cryptographic trust verification.**

This system is built to serve students, professionals in regulated industries (Finance, Legal, Health), and everyday users worldwide.

## ‚ú® Key Architectural Innovations

| Component | Function | Improvement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Multi-Modal Decoder (MMD)** | Accepts and standardizes **Text, Image, and Audio** inputs into a single format for processing. | **Universal Accessibility** and 3x broader utility. |
| **6x Domain Experts** | Specialized nodes (`finance_expert`, `legal_expert`, etc.) dedicated to focused, high-quality answers. | **Accuracy and Depth** far beyond general-purpose models. |
| **Causal Risk Assessor (CRA)** | Evaluates the answer content for risk (e.g., regulatory or health sensitivity) before delivery. | **Full Safety & Compliance** (enforces mandatory disclaimers). |
| **Meta-Cognition Loop** | Agents reflect on the success/failure of their own performance to update internal **Reputation (Q-Values)**. | **Autonomous Self-Improvement** and continuous learning. |
| **Knowledge Fusion Node** | Generalizes successful execution paths into a persistent knowledge base (`fusion_db.csv`). | **Increased Efficiency** by optimizing future routing decisions. |
| **Decentralized Verifiable Identity (DVID)** | Cryptographically **signs** the final answer using a unique Digital Identifier (DID). | **Unassailable Trust** and verifiable source auditing for professional use. |
| **Verifiable Audit Node** | Generates a final, tamper-evident **SHA-256 Hash** of the entire transaction history. | **Enhanced Security** and accountability. |

üß† Cognito œâ (Omega) System: The Autonomous, Verifiable AI Assistant
Version: 2.0 (Cloud-Native & Mobile API)
Status: Production-Ready Cloud Architecture with Integrated iOS Client Flow.
Architecture: LangGraph-based Multi-Agent System (MAS) deployed as a secure, containerized FastAPI REST API.

üöÄ Project Overview
The Cognito œâ System is now a cloud-native, scalable service accessible globally. The core 15-node LangGraph (featuring specialized expertise, autonomous self-improvement, and cryptographic trust verification) is packaged in a Docker container and exposed via a robust API endpoint. This architecture is designed for maximum compliance, security, and enterprise-level operation, aligning perfectly with Cloud Architect and AI Specialist standards.

‚ú® Key Architectural Innovations (Core System)

‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud & Mobile Integration Updates (v2.0)
The entire project has been transformed into a deployable, shareable cloud service.

1. Containerization & API Layer
Docker Integration: The entire Python environment, including LangGraph and dependencies, is now packaged into a single Docker image using a Dockerfile.

FastAPI Wrapper: The core logic is exposed via a FastAPI server (api_server.py) with a dedicated /query endpoint. This allows for clean, structured JSON communication.

Security Fixes: Replaced the unsafe eval() and enhanced the dynamic_tool_manager with secure JSON parsing and Pydantic validation for all structured inputs and outputs.

2. Cloud Deployment Architecture (AWS Focus)
Deployment Component	Role & Security
AWS ECS Fargate	Hosts the Docker container, providing serverless, scalable execution of the AI backend.
Application Load Balancer (ALB)	Distributes traffic and, critically, hosts the SSL Certificate from ACM to enforce HTTPS (mandatory for mobile).
AWS API Gateway	Placed in front of the ALB to enforce API Key Authentication (X-API-KEY header), protecting the service from unauthorized usage and securing user data.

3. Mobile Client Compliance (iOS App Store)
Native Client: Defined the architecture for a native iOS client built with SwiftUI and a robust APIService.swift layer.

Security Protocol: The client exclusively uses the HTTPS endpoint and securely transmits the API Key in the header of every request, ensuring compliance with Apple's App Transport Security (ATS) guidelines and App Store review requirements.

Compliance Enforced: The system is explicitly designed to meet App Store Review Guidelines concerning high-risk categories (Health/Finance) by using the CRA to mandate disclaimers in the final, verifiable output.

üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Deployment
Prerequisites
Python 3.11+

Docker

An OpenAI API Key (or a compatible LLM API key)

AWS CLI configured (for full cloud deployment)

Step 1: Initial Setup
Dependencies: Ensure all project files, including api_server.py, Dockerfile, and requirements.txt, are present.

Environment: Set your OPENAI_API_KEY in the .env file.

Step 2: Local Container Build and Test
Run these commands to build and test the FastAPI API locally before deploying to AWS:

Bash

# 1. Build the Docker image
docker build -t cognito-omega-api .

# 2. Run the container locally on port 8000
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name cognito-service cognito-omega-api

# 3. Test the API endpoint (e.g., using curl or Postman):
# curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query \
# -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
# -d '{"raw_user_input": "I need investment data on tax credits."}'
Step 3: Cloud Deployment
Follow the steps outlined for deploying the containerized service to AWS ECR ‚Üí AWS ECS Fargate ‚Üí ALB ‚Üí API Gateway to obtain the final, secure HTTPS public endpoint. This endpoint is what the mobile application will use.
